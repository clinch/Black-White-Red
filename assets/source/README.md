Assets
======

The source files for the images used were ones that I originally created in Flash.

- **Assets.fla** contains all the individual images (bulb, receptacle, etc)
- **Diagrams.fla** contains the full-size diagrams
- **DiagramThumbs.fla** contains simplified "thumbnail" images of each diagram

Todo

- Consider moving all assets to an appropriate illustration format (eg: Illustrator)
- Consider using actual vector images in the application itself instead of rasterized PNGs
